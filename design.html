      <LI>The process of designing a FIFA game involves several key steps:</LI>
      <p>1.Concept and Planning: The development team identifies the goals and features for the upcoming game, considering feedback from previous iterations and the current state of the football world. They plan the game's new features, improvements, and any licensing agreements needed for teams, players, and stadiums.</p>
      <P>2.Game Engine: FIFA games use a proprietary game engine developed by EA Sports. This engine is continually updated and enhanced to improve graphics, physics, and gameplay mechanics.</P>
      <P>3.Art and Graphics: Artists create realistic player models, stadiums, and other in-game assets. This includes capturing player faces and animations using advanced motion-capture technology to make the game look as authentic as possible.</P>
      <P>4.Gameplay Mechanics: Game designers focus on improving the realism and playability of the game. This involves refining passing, shooting, dribbling, and other fundamental aspects of football gameplay.</P>
      <P>5.Modes and Features: The team designs various game modes, such as Career Mode, Ultimate Team, and Pro Clubs, and adds new features and improvements to keep the game engaging and fresh.</P>
      <P>6.Testing and QA: Extensive playtesting and quality assurance are crucial to identifying and fixing bugs, balancing gameplay, and ensuring a smooth gaming experience.</P>
      <P>7.Annual Releases: FIFA games are typically released annually to coincide with the football season and include updates based on the latest real-world player and team data.

        The development process of FIFA games is iterative, with each year's release building upon the foundation of the previous installment. The goal is to provide players with an authentic and enjoyable football gaming experience that mirrors the excitement of the sport itself.</P>
